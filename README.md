# asana-standup-extension
Chromium extension to automate Standup in Asana

## Installation

I'm not paying for a Chrome Developer account, so install this plugin manually:

1. Clone this repo somewhere
2. In your chromium-based browser, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Somewhere on this page there will be a "Developer mode" toggle button. Enable it.
4. Now somewhere on this page there will be a button that says "Load unpacked". Click it.
5. Select the dir where you cloned this repo.
6. Profit.

## Updates

Manual for now.

1. `git pull origin main` this repo.
2. Go back to `chrome://extensions`
3. Click reload on the Asana Standup Extension.
